    <h1>Groove Bound (Prototype)</h1>
    <div class="summary-block">
        <b>Groove Bound</b> is a rhythm-based top-down shooter built with LÖVE2D (Lua). You control a character, dodging and shooting enemies while syncing your actions to the beat. The game features real-time settings adjustment, a responsive UI, and an extensible design for future features.<br><br>
        <b>How to Play:</b> Move with WASD or Arrow Keys, aim with the mouse, and shoot with left click or auto-fire. Survive as long as possible by dodging enemies and syncing your actions to the beat for bonuses. The game offers a smooth camera, modular codebase, and a game over screen with scoring.<br><br>
        <b>Project Status:</b> Core gameplay, beat system, and UI are implemented. The codebase is modular and ready for expansion, with plans for more enemies, power-ups, expanded settings, audio, and more polish.<br>
